Welcome to my blog! I plan to use this space to recap my activities on a weekly basis.

## What You Can Expect

I'll be doing weekly recaps of:

- What I'm working on.
- What I've learnt.
- Interesting things I've read.

I will keep this blog pretty simple to start off with, but there are a lot of things I want to do with this space down the line.

Thank you for reading!
